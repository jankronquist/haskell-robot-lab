# Haskell Robot Lab

This is an introductory Haskell lab. The point is to implement the function that
moves the robot given a string of commands. The commands are `G`, `R` and `L` for
Go, Right and Left respectively.

All you need is GHC and you should be able to get going. The `Robots.hs` file
defines a simple main function that takes commands as input and prints the
resulting robot and level.
